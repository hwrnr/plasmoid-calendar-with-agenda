# plasmoid-calendar-with-agenda
MOST OF THE WORK WAS DONE BY THE ORIGINAL PLASMOID AUTHORS, I DID VERY LITTLE!

Clone of the default plasma6 Digital Clock plasmoid, but some style changes and layout changes.

Specifically wanted to make this useable on the desktop and have an agenda on the calendar.

I switched the layout to vertical with the calendar on top of the agenda.

I removed background because that is what I wanted for my desktop layout.

To add a calendar you have to use Korganize and add an account there. Then in the configuration of the plasmoid (in desktop Edit Mode you can hover over plasmoid and select Configure ...)
