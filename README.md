# plasmoid-calendar-with-agenda
MOST OF THE WORK WAS DONE BY THE ORIGINAL PLASMOID AUTHORS, I DID VERY LITTLE!
SEE: https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/tree/master/applets/digital-clock/package?ref_type=heads

In the original project source code, the license is: GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only OR LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-GPL
Any code here is also the same license.

Highly based upon the default plasma6 Digital Clock plasmoid, but with some minor style changes and layout changes.  Specifically:
- Calendar is the desktop applet, not the clock
- Switched agenda to below calendar, instead of on the side
- I removed the applet background because that is what I wanted for my desktop layout

To add a calendar you have to use Korganize and add an account there. Configuration options for the plasmoid can be found in desktop Edit Mode (hover over the applet and select the Configure button)

This is provided AS-IS with no promise of further improvements.  Anyone is free to take this and make it better.  If I see pull-requests, I will look at them when I have time.  Hope this works temporarily until someone makes a better calendar and agenda widget for plasma 6.
